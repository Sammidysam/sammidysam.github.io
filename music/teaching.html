  <span class="content-emph">Current Location</span>
  Teaching bass is best done in-person and not online,
  so for now I am based in (and can teach students in) the
  Chicagoland area.
  I will add, though, that I am lenient on what I define as Chicagoland.
  If I can form a partnership with a community that is even up to a two-hour
  drive away, I could be interested in coming by once per week.

  <span class="content-emph">Contact Me</span>
  I am interested in teaching bass if it interests you!
  The easiest way to get in touch is to email me at
  <a href="mailto:craigsamm@gmail.com">craigsamm@gmail.com</a>.

  <span class="content-emph">Rates, etc.</span>
  It feels wrong to have an advertised rate on a website like this,
  as it will always change depending on my personal circumstances and my current
  point in my teaching journey.
  I will say that I never want the rate to be too steep to prevent
  bass study as an option, though.
  I intend to be working in software engineering, so I expect that my rates
  will be flexible.
  We can be in touch.

  <span class="content-emph">Philosophy</span>
  My biggest goal when teaching is for the material to be fun.
  If you love a song or a music group, let's explore that music and learn
  how it works and how we can play it!
  I happened to fall in love with classical music in the end, but
  it is not a requirement for you to.
  I am happy for us to chase your passion, together.

  In more direct terms, I expect lessons to cover technique
  (how can we play in a way that will never hurt and allow you to play into old age?),
  harmony (scales, chords, etc.),
  and melody (playing songs that you love).

  <span class="content-emph">Past Experience</span>
  I have been thrilled to get the opportunity to teach both in high school
  and at Oberlin Conservatory.
  In high school, I started teaching bass during my junior year, and proceeded
  to have four students total over the next two years.
  At Oberlin, I have volunteered with the public school orchestra a fair amount.
  During my first year, I helped out Oberlin's high school orchestra bassists, then
  their middle school orchestra bassists during my second year.
  During my third year, I started teaching some bass students in the
  <a href="https://www.noyo.org/">Northern Ohio Youth Orchestra (NOYO)</a> privately.
  I also taught private lessons to some students in the Oberlin public school
  system through Oberlin Conservatory's String Pedagogy II class.
  During the Covid pandemic, I taught one family friend online.
  When vaccinations started being abundant, I taught two students in NOYO in-person again.
