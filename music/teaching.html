  <span class="content-emph">Current Location</span>
  Teaching bass is best done in-person and not online,
  so for now I would like to restrict my teaching to the
  Chicagoland area.
  However, I have a large definition of Chicagoland.
  I am teaching one day per week (Mondays) in the Lafayette, Indiana
  area.
  If you are in a similar position of being a 2 hour drive or less from
  Chicago, perhaps it would work for me to start teaching in your community.
  Do not fear to be in touch.

  <span class="content-emph">Contact Me</span>
  I am interested in teaching bass if it interests you!
  The easiest way to get in touch is to email me at
  <a href="mailto:craigsamm@gmail.com">craigsamm@gmail.com</a>.
  I would offer my phone number too on this website,
  but I fear that I would get spam as a result.
  So, if you prefer reaching me by phone, send me an email to ask me
  for my phone number.

  <span class="content-emph">Teaching Rates</span>
  Before I start explaining my teaching rates, I want you to know that
  I care most about education being possible.
  If what I mention is too high to work for your situation, please still
  feel free to be in touch.
  It is very possible that we could work something out.
  At the more practical level, my current teaching rate is $30 for 30 minutes
  and $60 for an hour.
  If you are wondering how long of a lesson is best for your child,
  30 minutes is probably best.
  I have the option of teaching at your home for an additional fee
  that depends on where you live.

  <span class="content-emph">Philosophy</span>
  My biggest goal when teaching is for the material to be fun.
  If you love a song or a music group, let's explore that music and learn
  how it works and how we can play it!
  I happened to fall in love with classical music in the end, but
  it is not a requirement for you to.
  I am happy for us to chase your passion, together.

  In more direct terms, I expect lessons to cover technique
  (how can we play in a way that will never hurt and allow you to play into old age?),
  harmony (scales, chords, etc.),
  and melody (playing songs that you love).

  <span class="content-emph">Past Experience</span>
  I have been thrilled to get the opportunity to teach both in high school
  and at Oberlin Conservatory.
  In high school, I started teaching bass during my junior year, and proceeded
  to have four students total over the next two years.
  At Oberlin, I have volunteered with the public school orchestra a fair amount.
  During my first year, I helped out Oberlin's high school orchestra bassists, then
  their middle school orchestra bassists during my second year.
  During my third year, I started teaching some bass students in the
  <a href="https://www.noyo.org/">Northern Ohio Youth Orchestra (NOYO)</a> privately.
  I also taught private lessons to some students in the Oberlin public school
  system through Oberlin Conservatory's String Pedagogy II class.
  During the Covid pandemic, I taught one family friend online.
  When vaccinations started being abundant, I taught two students in NOYO in-person again.
