<p>
  <span class="content-emph">First Stint: Summer</span>
</p>

<p>
  Upper Hand was the first company at which I did a summer software engineering internship.
  I worked with them in the summer of 2019.
  This first summer with them, I had no full-time experience, so it took a bit
  for my responsibilities to ramp up to an exciting amount.
  Even with that, there is some accomplishments detailed below.
</p>

<p>
  The ending project of my 2019 stint with Upper Hand was an information panel
  that shows details about an instance of an event such as a gym class.
  It was so appreciated in the second half of the year that when clients of
  the software were surveyed at the end of 2019,
  this feature was the #1 most-liked feature.
  The feature was also viewed the third most of any feature within the application.
  Finally, this feature is very visible, as it only takes a little bit of scrolling
  on the Upper Hand website to find it.
  It is at the right of the Revolve Yoga screenshot - you can see that screenshot
  directly <a href="https://149627654.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Revolve-Yoga-Homepage.png">here</a>.

<p>
  In 2019, the other main project of my time was creating a wrapper for Material UI.
  The idea was to set up a layer between Material UI and our main application
  so that if Material UI were needed to be upgraded or we wanted to change the look
  of a certain component, we could change it in one place and it would get
  updated across the entire application immediately.
  I was the top contributor to this library,
  which led my code to be present across a huge amount of the application.

  <span class="content-emph">Second Stint: Academic Year</span>
</p>

<p>
  I had already entertained ideas of working a bit more with Upper Hand sometime
  before my college journey was over, but when the Covid pandemic began in March 2020,
  my plans got accelerated.
  Music school in a pandemic-affected environment sounded like a poor use of my time,
  so I quickly got in touch with the company and worked to set up working with them
  as opposed to attending college in the 2020-21 academic year.
  We started up in August of 2020 and I ended this stint with Upper Hand in
  May of 2021.
</p>

<p>
  The time at Upper Hand was split into three projects, the first of which
  was fixing bugs across the largest payments refactor in the history of the company.
  The refactor had been going on for months when I started up work in August,
  and I had to quickly learn the new data model in order to be able to make changes
  across the entire scope: UI, API, and data migration.
</p>

<p>
  After that refactor was complete, the next project was to use the flexibility
  created by the refactor in order to integrate a new credit card reader with the
  Upper Hand software.
  This involved interacting with payments processors through REST APIs and
  setting up WebSockets with the Upper Hand software for the first time.
  The previous supported credit card reader had major issues, so this was a very welcome
  addition.
  As of this date, at least hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions,
  has been moved using this code.
  Certainly more than I can comprehend at this point in my life!
</p>

<p>
  The final project at Upper Hand was to finish up an unfinished report at Upper Hand,
  the monthly recurring revenue report.
  This report details income coming from recurring sources, such as memberships
  at gyms.
  This project involved designing a SQL table to store temporary results in a ledger
  fashion, writing a PostgreSQL migration to populate this table with historic data,
  designing and implementing API endpoints to allow retrieval of these data,
  and fixing up some UI issues in order to have the data displayed.
  The promotional material for this project is located <a href="https://upperhand.com/software/membership-analytics/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  As is likely evident, the bulk of my work at Upper Hand was in payments.
  I did not expect this when I started up work, but I found it a very reasonable place
  for me to be.
  I like working with data and databases.
  I also enjoy crafting well-designed APIs.
  All of this became very illuminated to me from my year working at Upper Hand.

<p>
  Working at Upper Hand was an incredible confidence-building time for me.
  I grew up being rather lacking in self-confidence, but everyone
  at the company was incredibly complimentary both during and after
  I was working there, which rubbed off on to me.
  After all, my work in the summer of 2019 was good enough that when
  they got a sudden text from me wanting to work soon due to the pandemic,
  they were all on board.
  Then, the projects that I did during the academic year that I took off
  to work were significant.
  There are likely millions of dollars that have moved between people
  as a result of my code, and at the time of writing that code,
  I was yet to have had an official full-time job.
  This terrific start to meaningful projects only makes me more excited
  about what I will accomplish in my full-time career.
