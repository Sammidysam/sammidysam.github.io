<span class="page-title">My Work with Upper Hand</span>

<p>
  Below I detail my 2019 work with Upper Hand.
  The 2020-21 work will be detailed soon!
</p>

<p>
  Upper Hand was the first company at which I did a summer software engineering internship.
  I worked with them in the summer of 2019.
  This first summer with them, I had no full-time experience, so it took a bit
  for my responsibilities to ramp up to an exciting amount.
  Even with that, there is some accomplishments detailed below.

  The ending project of my 2019 stint with Upper Hand was an information panel
  that shows details about an instance of an event such as a gym class.
  It was so appreciated in the second half of the year that when clients of
  the software were surveyed at the end of 2019,
  this feature was the #1 most-liked feature.
  The feature was also viewed the third most of any feature within the application.
  Finally, this feature is very visible, as it only takes a little bit of scrolling
  on the Upper Hand website to find it.
  It is at the right of the Revolve Yoga screenshot - you can see that screenshot
  directly <a href="https://149627654.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Revolve-Yoga-Homepage.png">here</a>.

  In 2019, the other main project of my time was creating a wrapper for Material UI.
  The idea was to set up a layer between Material UI and our main application
  so that if Material UI were needed to be upgraded or we wanted to change the look
  of a certain component, we could change it in one place and it would get
  updated across the entire application immediately.
  I was the top contributor to this library,
  which led my code to be present across a huge amount of the application.
